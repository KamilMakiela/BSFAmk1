# Bayesian Stochastic Frontier Analysis with Matlab

**Kamil Makie≈Ça** 

The purpose of this program is to run stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) using Bayesian approach (BSFA) in MATLAB. The program can run several different types of stochastic frontier models and a number of different parametric specifications of the frontier. The graphical user interface makes the program especially appealing for practitioners who wish to perform automated, high-quality stochastic frontier analyses using Bayesian inference. Estimation algorithms adopted in the program are based on well-documented methods in the BSFA literature. It is intendent mainly for panel data analyses, however, those parametric specifications of the stochastic frontier which assume no time variation can be used in a cross-section study.

To run the program just download all the files and run **BSFA_mk1.fig**, which is its GUI. See **README.pdf** for a detailed description on ho to use it.
