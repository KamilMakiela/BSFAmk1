# Bayesian Stochastic Frontier Analysis with Matlab

**Kamil Makie≈Ça** 

The purpose of the program is to run stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) using Bayesian approach, BSFA hereafter. The program is written in MATLAB and implements well-known SFA models like normal-exponential and normal-half-normal as well as two Varrying Efficiency Distribution (VED) models. It is intendent mainly for panel data analyses, however, those parametric specifications of the stochastic frontier which assume no time variation can be used in a cross-section study.

See **README.pdf** file for details about the program.
